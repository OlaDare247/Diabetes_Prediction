# Diabetes_Prediction
# This project looks into diabetes prediction using machine learning tools
#    In this Kaggle project, we explored the importance of feature engineering in improving the performance of machine learning models. 
We began with analyzing the dataset and we analyzed potential features by corr map for creating new and effective features. Using various techniques such as one-hot encoding, scaling, and feature selection, we generated a set of engineered features that were more informative and relevant for our model.
# We then trained several machine learning models on the original dataset and compared their performance using various evaluation metric like accuracy(we need to also use precision, recall, and F1-score for better understanding). Our result showed that feature engineering can significantly improve the accuracy score of machine learning models.
# We also experimented with different combinations of features and hyperparameters to find the optimal configuration for our models. 
By fine-tuning the models and selecting the best features, we were able to achieve a high level of accuracy on the test set, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.
# In conclusion, feature engineering is a critical step in the machine learning pipeline that can have a significant impact on the performance of models. 
By carefully selecting and transforming features, we can improve the quality of the input data and enhance the ability of our models to capture complex relationships in the data
